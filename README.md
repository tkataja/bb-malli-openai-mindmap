# Simple React App with Vite

This project is a simple React application using Vite as the build tool.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (version 6 or later)

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**:

   This will start the Vite development server, which will watch for changes and automatically reload the app in the browser.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production**:

   This will create an optimized production build in the `dist` directory.

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Preview the production build**:

   This will serve the production build locally so you can test it.

   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```
